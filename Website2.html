			<div><p>During the Renaissance, great advances occurred in geography, astronomy, chemistry, physics, mathematics, manufacturing, anatomy and 
					engineering. The rediscovery of ancient scientific texts was accelerated after the 
					Fall of Constantinople in 1453, and the invention of printing which would democratize 
					learning and allow a faster propagation of new ideas. But, at least in its initial period, 
					some see the Renaissance as one of scientific backwardness. Historians like George Sarton and 
					Lynn Thorndike have criticized how the Renaissance affected science, arguing that progress 
					was slowed for some amount of time. Humanists favored human-centered subjects like politics 
					and history over study of natural philosophy or applied mathematics. Others have focused on 
					the positive influence of the Renaissance, pointing to factors like the rediscovery of lost 
					or obscure texts and the increased emphasis on the study of language and the correct reading 
					of texts.</p></div>
			<div><p>The scientific revolution was the emergence of modern 
					science during the early modern period, when developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, 
					biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed views of society and nature.
					The scientific revolution began in Europe towards the end of the Renaissance period and 
					continued through the late 18th century, influencing the intellectual social movement known 
					as the Enlightenment. While its dates are disputed, the publication in 1543 of Nicolaus 
					Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) 
					is often cited as marking the beginning of the scientific revolution.</p></div>
			<div><p>The Punic Wars were a series of three wars fought between 
					Rome and Carthage from 264 BC to 146 BC. At the time, they were probably the largest wars 
					that had ever taken place. The term Punic comes from the Latin word Punicus (or Poenicus), 
					meaning "Carthaginian", with reference to the Carthaginians' Phoenician ancestry. The main 
					cause of the Punic Wars was the conflicts of interest between the existing Carthaginian Empire 
					and the expanding Roman Republic. The Romans were initially interested in expansion via Sicily 
					(which at that time was a cultural melting pot), part of which lay under Carthaginian control. 
					At the start of the first Punic War, Carthage was the dominant power of the 
					Western Mediterranean, with an extensive maritime empire. Rome was a rapidly 
					ascending power in Italy, but it lacked the naval power of Carthage. By the end of the 
					third war, after more than a hundred years and the loss of many hundreds of thousands of 
					soldiers from both sides, Rome had conquered Carthage's empire, completely destroyed the city, 
					and become the most powerful state of the Western Mediterranean.</p></div>
